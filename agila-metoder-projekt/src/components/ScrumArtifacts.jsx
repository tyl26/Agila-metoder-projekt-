            <h1>What is Scrum Artefacts?</h1>

            <p>Scrumâ€™s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.

                Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:
                <ul>
                    <li> For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal. This is where the " what to do"</li>
                    <li> For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal. This is where the " what to take now + how"</li>
                    <li> For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.  This is where the " what gets done"
                    </li>
                </ul>

                These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.</p>
