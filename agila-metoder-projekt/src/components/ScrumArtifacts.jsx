            <h1>What is Scrum Artefacts?</h1>

            <p>Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.

                Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:

                -For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal. This is where the " what to do"
 
                -For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal. This is where the " what to take now + how"

                -For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.  This is where the " what gets done"

                These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.</p>
